# Overview

Boundary has a rich domain model
consisting of resources that represent
[IAM][] principals,
infrastructure,
and the means to tie them together.
This section contains information about the various resources within the domain
and how they relate to each other.

## Resources

A resource is any element in Boundary
to which principals may be granted permissions.
All resources have an ID which is unique within Boundary.

### Summary of Resources

- **Account** :
  An account is a resource
  that represents a unique set of credentials
  issued from a configured authentication method
  which can be used to establish the identity of a user.
  A user can have zero or more accounts
  but an account can only belong to a single user.
  An account can only be associated with a user
  in the same scope as the account's auth method.

- **Credential** :
  A credential is a data structure containing one or more secrets
  that binds an identity to a set of permissions or capabilities
  on a host for a session.

- **Credential Libraries** :
  A credential library is a resource
  that provides credentials
  of the same type and same access level
  from a single credential store.

- **Credential Store** :
  A credential store is a resource
  that can retrieve, store, and potentially generate credentials
  of differing types and differing access levels.
  It may also contain credential libraries.
  It belongs to a project and supports the
  [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)
  by providing mechanisms to limit the credentials it can access
  to the minimum necessary for the project it is in.
  A credential store can also contain credential libraries.

- **Authentication Method** :
  An authentication method is a resource
  that provides a mechanism
  for users to authenticate to Boundary.
  An auth method contains accounts which link an
  individual user to a set of credentials and managed groups which groups
  accounts that satisfy criteria and can be used as principals in roles.
  Auth methods can be defined at either a Global or Organization
  scope.

- **Group** :
  A group is a resource
  that represents a collection of users
  which can be treated equally
  for the purposes of access control.
  A group is a principal
  which allows it to be assigned to roles.
  Any role assigned to a group is indirectly assigned to the users in the group.
  This assignment is a transitive property.
  A user in a group receives all permissions of the roles assigned to the group.
  Groups can be defined at the Global, Organization, or Project scope.

- **Host** :
  A host is a resource
  that represents a computing element with a network address
  reachable from Boundary.
  A host belongs to a host catalog.
  Hosts can only be associated with host sets
  from the same host catalog as the host.

- **Host Catalog** :
  A host catalog is a resource
  that contains hosts and host sets.
  A host catalog can only be defined within a project.

- **Host Set** :
  A host set is a resource
  that represents a collection of hosts
  which are considered equivalent
  for the purposes of access control.
  A host set can only include hosts
  from the same host catalog as the host set.
  A target can reference host sets from host catalogs
  which belong to the same project as the target.

- **Managed Group** :
  A managed group is a resource that represents a collection of accounts. The
  collection is formed by evaluating account information defined by the auth
  method's identity provider against the managed group's configuration; members
  cannot be managed manually. An account can be associated with zero or more
  managed groups within the same auth method. The managed group can be used as
  a principal within roles to assign grants..

- **Role** :
  A role is a resource
  that contains a collection of permissions
  which are granted to any principal assigned to the role.
  Users, groups, and managed groups are principals
  which allows either to be assigned to a role.
  A role can be defined within any scope.
  A role can be assigned to principals from any scope.

- **Session** :
  A session is
  a set of related connections
  between a user and a host.
  A session may include a set of credentials
  which define the permissions granted to the user on the host for the duration
  of the session.

  A user initiates a session
  by requesting access to a target.
  If a user has the proper permissions,
  a session is created
  and the expiration time and connection limit
  are set based on the target's attributes.
  If the target is associated with credential libraries,
  credentials are retrieved and returned from each
  credential library.
  A snapshot of the data
  relevant to authorizing the session
  is also captured and stored in the Boundary data warehouse
  when the session is created.

  Sessions are created in the project of the corresponding target.
  Deleting a project will terminate all of the active sessions in the project
  but will not effect any session data in the data warehouse.
  Historical data in the data warehouse is never deleted.

- **Scope** :
  A scope is a permission boundary modeled as a container.
  There are three types of scopes in Boundary:
  A single global scope which is the outermost container;
  organizations(orgs) which are contained by the global scope;
  and projects which are contained by orgs.
  Each scope is itself a resource.

  - Global: The global scope is the outermost scope.
    There is always a single global scope
    and it cannot be deleted.
    The global scope can directly contain:
    users, groups, auth methods, and organizations.

  - Organizations: An org is a scope directly contained by the global scope.
    There can be multiple orgs within the global scope.
    An org can directly contain:
    users, groups, auth methods, roles, and projects.

  - Projects: A project is a scope directly contained by an org scope.
    There can be multiple projects within an org.
    A project can directly contain:
    roles, targets, host catalogs, and credential stores.

- **Target** :
  A target is a resource
  that represents a networked service
  with an associated set of permissions
  a user can connect to
  and interact with
  through Boundary
  by way of a session.
  A target can only be defined within a project.
  A target can contain references to host sets from host catalogs
  which belong to the same project as the target.
  A target can contain references to credential libraries
  from credential stores which belong to the same project as the target.
  A user can establish a session with a host
  in any host set referenced by the target
  if the user has been assigned a role
  with the `authorize-session` permission
  for the target.

- **User** :
  A user is a resource
  that represents an individual person or entity
  for the purposes of access control.

## Next Steps

When getting started with Boundary,
the first resource to look at should probably be Scopes.
Every other resources is either contained within a scope,
or contained within another resource
that is itself contained within a scope.
That page can help you understand the structure of resources within Boundary.
